27,83.0,89.96, for the COVID and we thank all the authors for the slides provided with the book and also on the website
28,89.96,99.32, some of which we are using in this presentation. The rules of this course you should ask questions
29,99.32,106.28, through discussion forums and feel free to ask any question your perspective may be different
30,106.28,112.76, or more apt in mind. Correct me if I make a mistake remember I am in a continuous learning mode
31,113.16000000000001,121.32000000000001, do not take notes this slide that will be available on the web and finally please make sure
32,121.32000000000001,127.48, your cell phones are in shearing mode your chat window in busy mode so that you give undivided
33,127.48,138.52, attention to understand the course. Now we just want to reiterate the learning objectives
34,138.52,147.48000000000002, upon completion of this lecture you should be able to understand what information security
35,148.20000000000002,155.16000000000003, in the modern day contest and also in early days it was called computer security how it evolved
36,155.16000000000003,162.20000000000002, into information security understand many key terms and critical concepts of information security
37,162.2,172.11999999999998, of modern day and most importantly understand the way a organization which is IT driven the IT
38,172.11999999999998,177.79999999999998, management of an organization what would be the organogram of that organization who would be
39,177.79999999999998,186.12, responsible for doing what all these four objectives are very important to appreciate
40,186.20000000000002,192.28, information security and each of these objectives will have some subtle concepts.
41,194.68,199.72, I hope many of you know Burton Roussel so Burton Roussel came out with a small statement
42,200.52,205.88, very very small he is very much well known for very small jargons or very small statements
43,205.88,211.96, is that obviousness is the enemy of correctness many of the things that we will be teaching in this
44,211.96,219.4, course are will be debating in this course are obvious things which are not followed and because
45,219.4,227.88, of that we land up with issues. So we will be teaching you the obvious things in and what it means
46,228.12,234.76000000000002, if you do not if you neglect those things in the global scenario. So this is what would be our
47,234.76,245.48, learning objectives. This course has mentioned earlier has six modules this is sub module of
48,245.48,252.44, module one and what we will be discussing in the entire module one would be what is information
49,252.44,259.71999999999997, security why do you need it then CIA is a very very important term in information security
50,259.8,268.28000000000003, which basically talks about confidentiality integrity and availability and to bring this
51,268.28000000000003,275.08000000000004, confidentiality integrity and availability into the information security system there are lot of
52,275.08000000000004,281.64000000000004, things that need to be done and what you see in the three bullet points that follow are those
53,282.20000000000005,288.52000000000004, that are necessary to build in confidentiality integrity and availability into a system.
54,289.0,297.24, For example policies procedures guidelines standard from a security perspective what are all
55,297.24,305.64, the administrative measures and technical measures needed to enforce these three the CIA which are
56,305.64,311.96, basically the foundations of information security or the goals of information security.
57,312.2,322.35999999999996, We also look at people process and technology people are the are the ones who follow a process
58,322.91999999999996,329.56, and these processes are implemented by technology. So security should be addressed at the technology
59,329.56,337.64, level and the process which uses this technology and the people who actually use as these processes.
60,337.64,346.03999999999996, So there is lot of information lot of disciplines and policies and procedures that people that
61,346.59999999999997,353.4, need to be implemented at each one of these stages namely at the people level at the process level
62,353.4,357.56, and technology level and this module will talk deeply about that.
63,358.2,369.16," Now, we are talking about Kevin Mitnik who is actually an hacker actually was a cyber criminal"
64,370.36,379.0, and he was actually captured by arrested by FBI. He came back and he became one of the world's
65,379.96,391.24, one of the world renowned computer security experts and he came out with this very interesting
66,391.24,397.8, statement again it is a very obvious statement people are the weakest link. This is this particular
67,397.8,406.76, phrase is known for decades now that whenever I that is a security lapse majorly may it is going
68,406.92,415.64, to be because of people's unawareness about certain security measures. Though we know that people
69,415.64,425.08, are the weakest link many many organizations do not actually invest in educating the people on the
70,425.08,432.52, issues of security. So this is Kevin Mitnik statement that you read on the screen. You can have
71,432.59999999999997,438.2," the best technology firewalls, intrusions, deductions, systems, biometrics devices, somebody"
72,438.2,447.64, care but somebody can call an unsuspecting employee but all is that if a small leak from the
73,447.64,455.71999999999997, people from the employee side the human error or human carelessness that could essentially kill
74,456.12,467.64000000000004, entire system and this is reality. So Jim Anderson came out with this very interesting
75,467.64000000000004,474.20000000000005, definition of information security especially in today's enterprise world where we have huge
76,474.20000000000005,482.36, data centers it is nothing but a well informed sense of assurance that the information risks
77,482.36,491.56, and controls are in balance. For every risk I have a way to control that. I take a risk I have
78,491.56,499.24, enough checks and balances to control it. So if that assurance is given then your information
79,499.24,504.12, is actually secure and this is the definition that was given by Jim Anderson.
80,505.32,511.24, Now we go into some history of information security because we have to learn the lessons of the
81,511.24,519.88, past to go and appreciate the present and the future. The computer security basically began that
82,519.88,524.92, time it was computer security it began immediately after the first mind frames were developed.
83,525.96,530.04, There were groups developing code breaking computations during World War II
84,531.8,540.12, which created the first modern computers. Physical controls at that point to secure these computing
85,541.08,548.2, machines which actually stored some information which is very sensitive. There were no network but
86,548.2,554.28, they had some lot of physical controls essentially they want to physically secure the system.
87,554.76,561.08, Physically secure means it should not be broken manually damaged it should not be taken out of
88,561.08,569.0, a place it should be under lock and key. So the physical controls were read at to limit
89,569.72,573.72, limit access to authorized persons to sensitive memory locations.
90,574.44,579.8, And only rudimentary controls were available to defend against this physical
91,579.8,588.76," theft, espionage and sabotage. The Enigma was the first German computer which was actually"
92,588.76,593.56, used for sending code message. So here is a small description of Enigma.
93,593.64,605.2399999999999, So the entire notion of security started with the advanced research project agency ARPA
94,605.7199999999999,610.52, which began examining the feasibility of a redundant network communications.
95,611.4,617.8, This was basically headed by Larry Roberts who has developed the project from its inception.
96,618.3599999999999,622.1999999999999, Larry Roberts is known for his contribution to the internet.
97,623.4799999999999,633.0, So if you just look at the ARPA net program plan the program plan was to basically share if
98,633.0,639.0799999999999, you carefully look into it the objective was to develop networking and resource sharing.
99,640.3599999999999,647.16, So when this is the first notion where computers were the resources available on multiple
100,647.16,659.48, computers were shared. The ARPA net actually grew in popularity between the 70s and the 80s
101,661.0,668.52, as and so were the potentials for misuse. The fundamental problem with ARPA net security were
102,669.64,674.8399999999999, identified at that point. First and foremost there was no safety procedures for
103,674.84,681.1600000000001, dialogue collections and user identification and authorization to the system were nonexistent.
104,682.76,689.96, So in the late 1970s the microprocessor expanded computing capabilities and security threats.
105,690.6,697.88, So the ARPA net which was connecting these microprocessor essentially brought in a notion of security
106,698.36,705.64, wherein somebody dials up a connection you see an authentic person you see authorized to develop
107,705.64,710.68, develop that correction and somebody starts using the system that she has the necessary
108,710.68,718.12, identification and authorization and these are all something which became issues with ARPA net
109,718.12,722.52, and this started as early as 1970s and 80s.
110,723.24,733.8, Then came out the R609 which is called the RAND report which formed the first report on computer
111,733.8,744.4399999999999, security. The scope of computer security grew from physical security to include safety of the data
112,745.4,751.3199999999999, limiting unauthorized access to the data and also involvement of personal from multi levels of
113,751.32,758.9200000000001, the organization and each having some specific authorization to use the computers at with some
114,759.24,768.44, level of security. So if you look at what happened immediately after World War was that people were
115,768.44,776.6, more interested in having the computer at Locke & Key. There was no notion of sharing the
116,776.6,784.84, resources between computers and slowly came the ARPA where people started sharing the systems
117,784.84,790.9200000000001, and the moment they started sharing then the issues of is the correct fellow logging into the system
118,790.9200000000001,798.76, is he dialing up is he using the data. So more than the physical security of the computer
119,798.76,805.8000000000001, people started realizing even in the late 70s and early 80s that the data in the computer can be
120,805.8,814.52, stolen without physically accessing the computer and that the first notions of that was reflected
121,814.52,827.9599999999999, in this RAND report R609. In the 1990s networks of computers became more common in the civilian sector
122,828.36,837.08, and so did the need to interconnect the networks. So this resulted in a massive global network which
123,837.08,844.12, we today call as the internet but in those days still in this large scale internet deployments
124,844.52,851.72, security unfortunately was treated as a low priority because information that is stored in the
125,851.72,861.08, computer can be sensitive is a field which people did not realize much during those time.
126,861.8000000000001,868.36, They taught a network is basically used for sharing the resources and data also became something
127,868.36,874.9200000000001, that some can someone can share and they wanted to share the data but there are going to be unsarable
128,875.0,882.68, data within a system is something a realization which did not immediately occur to the people of the
129,882.68,888.76, early 1990s and that is why when you look at large scale internet deployments of those days
130,888.76,897.0, security was still given low priority. The present the internet has brought millions of
131,897.0,901.9599999999999, computer networks into communication with each other and many of them are still unsecured.
132,902.12,909.1600000000001, So the ability to secure each now influenced by the security on every computer to which it is
133,909.1600000000001,919.24, connected. As I mentioned in my welcome talk a mistake done by one system a vulnerability on one
134,919.24,928.0400000000001, system can launch a massive denial of service attack on the entire land and this is something that
135,928.04,937.88, one need to be careful and so the present system requires a large scale awareness and discipline
136,937.88,947.0799999999999, in system usage to bring things under control. So what is today's environment look at all these
137,947.08,953.48, wise Kai Pee Bay YouTube Blackberry Facebook comments on iPhone live by iPad Google
138,957.1600000000001,964.2800000000001, the world Google has actually become a verb a they want something Google it right so
139,966.0400000000001,975.0, today so many organizations have trillions and trillions of data and millions and millions of
140,975.0,985.16, users communicating using this data and that everyone wants some level of security and privacy
141,985.16,993.88, and confidentiality and availability. Now the entire gamut of information security is to
142,994.76,1003.16, is to come out with a policy a process a procedure a technology which will go and enable
143,1003.96,1011.88, a major secure feeling and assurance will give you a major secure assurance to this millions
144,1011.88,1019.56, and millions of users about the privacy availability confidentiality integrity of the trillions
145,1019.56,1029.56, of trillions of data that they are using.
146,1049.56,1059.56, So what is today's environment look at all these data and what is today's environment look at all these data and
147,1059.56,1069.56, what is today's environment look at all these data and what is today's environment look at all these data and
