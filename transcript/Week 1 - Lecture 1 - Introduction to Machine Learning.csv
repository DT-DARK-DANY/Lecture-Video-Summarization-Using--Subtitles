0,0.0,22.96," Hello, Riba and welcome to this NPTEL course on an introduction to machine learning. In"
1,22.96,30.400000000000002," this course, we will have a quick introduction to machine learning and this will not be very"
2,30.400000000000002,35.96," deep in a mathematical sense, but it will have some amount of mathematical trigger. And"
3,35.96,42.08, what we will be doing in this course is covering different paradigms of machine learning and
4,42.08,47.84, with special emphasis on classification and regression tasks and also will introduce you
5,47.84,55.120000000000005," to various other machine learning paradigms. In this introductory lecture, set of lectures,"
6,55.120000000000005,61.440000000000005," I will give a very quick overview of the different kinds of machine learning paradigms. And therefore,"
7,61.440000000000005,68.48," I call this lectures machine learning a brief introduction with emphasis on brief. So,"
8,68.48,74.88, the rest of the course would be a more elongated introduction to machine learning.
9,74.88,82.24," So, what is machine learning? So, I will start off with a canonical definition put out by Tom"
10,82.24,92.8," Mitchell in 97. So, a machine or an agent, I deliberately leave the beginning undefined because"
11,92.8,99.28," you could also apply this to non machines like biological agents. So, an agent is set to learn"
12,99.36,107.68, from experience with respect to some class of tasks and the performance measure P if the
13,107.68,114.32000000000001, learner's performance at tasks in the class as measured by P improves with experience.
14,115.52000000000001,123.12," So, what we get from this? First thing is we have to define learning with respect to a specific"
15,123.12,130.32, class of tasks. It could be answering exams in a particular subject or it could be diagnosing
16,132.16,138.96, patients of a specific illness. But we have to be very careful about defining the set of tasks
17,138.96,145.20000000000002, on which you are going to define this learning. And the second thing we need is kind of a performance
18,145.20000000000002,151.76," measure P. So, in the absence of a performance measure P, you would start make vague statement like,"
19,151.92,157.28, I think something is happening right that seems to be a change and something learned there is some
20,157.28,164.64," learning going on and stuff like that. So, if you want to be more clear about measuring whether"
21,164.64,169.35999999999999," learning is happening or not, you first need to define some kind of a performance criteria."
22,170.16,175.6," So, for example, if you talk about answering questions in exam, your performance criterion could"
23,175.6,183.04," very well be the number of marks that you get or if you talk about diagnosing illness,"
24,183.04,188.72, then your performance measure would be the number of patients that you save or the number of
25,189.6,194.16, patients who did not have adverse reaction to the drugs you gave them. There could be a variety of
26,194.16,197.28, ways of defining performance measures depending on what you are looking for.
27,198.32,205.28," And the third important component here is experience. So, with experience the performance has"
28,205.28,211.76," to improve. And so, what we mean by experience here in the case of writing exams, it could be"
29,211.76,216.32," writing more exams. So, the more the number of exams you write, the better you write it,"
30,216.32,223.68," the better you get it is taking or it could be patients in the case of diagnosing illnesses,"
31,223.68,229.36, the more patients that you look at the better you become at diagnosing illness.
32,230.24,234.64," So, these are the three components. So, you need a class of tasks, you need a performance"
33,234.64,243.27999999999997," measure and you need some well-defined experience. So, this kind of learning, where you are learning"
34,244.32,253.11999999999998," to improve your performance based on experience is known as this kind of learning, where you are"
35,253.11999999999998,258.0, trying to learn to improve your performance with experience is known as inductive learning.
36,258.64,265.92," And the basis of inductive learning goes back several centuries, people have been debating"
37,265.92,273.52, about inductive learning for hundreds of years now. And really more recently we have started to have
38,274.48,283.52," more quantified mechanisms of learning. But one thing I always point out to people is that,"
39,283.52,287.6," if you take this definition with the pinch of salt. So, for example, you could"
40,288.08,300.0," think about the task as fitting your foot comfortably. So, you could talk about whether a"
41,300.0,310.24," slipper fits your foot comfortably or let me. So, I always say that you should take this definition"
42,310.32,317.2," with a pinch of salt because, take the example of a slipper. So, the slipper is"
43,318.0,323.68," supposed to give protection to your foot and performance measured for the slipper would be,"
44,323.68,330.08, whether it is fitting the leg comfortably or not or whether it is as people say that is biting
45,330.08,337.52, your leg or is it chaffing your feet. And with experience as the slipper knows more and more about
46,337.52,342.32," your foot as you keep wearing the slipper for longer periods of time, it becomes better at the"
47,342.32,347.84, task of fitting your foot right as measured by whether it is chaffing your foot or whether it
48,347.84,353.2," is biting your foot or not right. So, would you say that the slipper is learned to fit your foot"
49,355.59999999999997,361.84," well by this definition yes right. So, we have to take this with a pinch of salt and so not"
50,362.71999999999997,370.0, every system that confirms to this definition of learning can be set to learn usually.
51,372.15999999999997,377.12," So, going on so there are different machine learning paradigms that we will talk about and the first"
52,377.12,385.52," one is supervised learning where you learn an input to output map right. So, given some kind of"
53,385.52,391.59999999999997, an input it could be a description of the patient who comes to comes to the clinic and the output
54,391.76000000000005,395.84000000000003," that how to produce is whether the patient has a certain disease or not right. So, this at learn"
55,395.84000000000003,401.04, this kind of an input to output map or the input could be some kind of a question right and then
56,401.04,405.20000000000005, the output would be the answer to the question or it could be a true or false question I give you
57,405.20000000000005,409.68, a description of the question you had to give me true or false is the output. And in supervised
58,409.68,415.6, learning what you essentially do is learn a mapping from this inputs to the required output right.
59,415.6,420.88, If the output that you are looking for happens to be a categorical output like whether he has a
60,420.88,425.36, disease or does not have a disease or whether the answer is true or false then the supervised learning
61,425.36,431.68, problem is called a classification problem right. And if the output happens to be a continuous
62,431.68,438.64, value like so how long will this product last before it fails right or what is the expected
63,438.64,444.0," rainfall tomorrow right. So, these kinds of problems they would be called as regression problems"
64,444.0,449.76, right. These are supervised learning problems where the output is a continuous value and these are
65,449.76,453.44," called as regression problems right. So, we will look at in more detailed classification"
66,453.44,458.32," and regression as we go on right. So, the second class of problems are known as unsupervised"
67,458.32,464.0, learning problems right where the goal is not really to produce an output in response to an input
68,464.0,469.92," but given a set of in data right we have to discover patterns in the data right. So, that is more"
69,469.92,476.0, of that that is called unsupervised learning there is no real desired output that we are looking for
70,476.48,481.92," you are more interested in finding patterns in the data right. So, clustering right is one"
71,482.48,487.76, a task one unsupervised learning task where you are interested in finding cohesive groups
72,487.76,493.76," among the input patterns right. So, for example, I might be looking at customers who come to my shop"
73,493.76,498.08," right and I want to figure out if there are categories of customers right. So, maybe college students"
74,498.08,503.2," could be one category and so, A&I-T professionals could be another category and so on so forth."
75,503.2,507.92," I mean when I am looking at this kinds of grouping in my data. So, I would call that as a clustering"
76,507.92,513.92," task right. So, the other popular unsupervised learning paradigm is known as association rule"
77,513.92,519.52, mining or frequent pattern mining where you are interested in finding frequent co-occurrence
78,519.52,526.56," of items right in the data that is given to you. So, whenever A comes to my shop B also comes"
79,526.56,533.68," to my shop right. So, those kinds of co-occurrence so, I can always say that if I see A then that is"
80,533.68,538.4799999999999," likely very likely that B is also in my shop somewhere you know. So, I can learn this kinds of"
81,538.4799999999999,545.1999999999999, associations between data right and again we look at this later in more detail and this are I mean
82,545.1999999999999,550.4," there are many different variants on supervised unsupervised learning, but these are the main ones"
83,550.4,555.1999999999999," that we look at. So, the third form of learning which is called reinforcement learning"
84,555.2800000000001,561.0400000000001, it is neither supervised nor unsupervised in nature and typically these are problems where you are
85,561.0400000000001,565.6800000000001, learning to control the behavior of a system and I will give you more intuition into reinforcement
86,565.6800000000001,576.1600000000001," learning in one of the later modules right. So, like I said earlier so, for every task right. So,"
87,576.1600000000001,580.32," you need to have some kind of a performance measure. So, if you are looking at classification"
88,580.4000000000001,585.5200000000001," the performance measure is going to be classification error. So, typically right. So, we will talk about"
89,586.24,591.84," many many different performance measures in the duration of this course, but the typical performance"
90,591.84,596.72," measure you would want to use is classification error right. So, how many of the items or how many of"
91,596.72,601.36," the patients did I get incorrect. So, how many of them who are not having the disease"
92,601.36,605.84," detect predict had the disease and how many of them that had the disease that I missed right. So,"
93,605.84,610.0, that would be one of the measures that I would use and that would be the measure that we want to
94,610.48,618.24," use, but we will see later that often that is not possible to actually learn directly with respect"
95,618.24,624.4," to this measure. So, we use other forms right and likewise for regression again. So, we have the"
96,624.4,630.88, the prediction error. Suppose I say it is going to rain like 23 millimeters and then it ends up
97,630.88,637.92," raining like 49 centimeters I do not know. So, that is a huge huge prediction error right."
98,638.48,645.76," And in terms of clustering. So, this is a little becomes a little trick here to define performance"
99,645.76,650.96, measures. We do not know what is a good clustering algorithm because we do not know what how to measure
100,650.96,656.48," the quality of clusters. So, people come up with all different kinds of measures and so one of the"
101,656.48,664.48, more popular ones is scatter or spread of the cluster that essentially tells you how spread out
102,664.48,669.28, the points are that belong to a single group. If you remember we are supposed to find cohesive
103,669.28,674.24," groups. So, if the group is not that cohesive it is not all of them are not together then you"
104,674.24,680.4, would say the clustering is of a poorer quality right. And if you have other ways of measuring
105,680.48,686.4," things like I like we are telling you. So, if you know that people are college students right and"
106,686.4,691.84," then you can figure out that how many what fraction of your cluster or college students. So,"
107,691.84,696.56," you can do this kinds of external evaluations. So, one measure that people use popularly there is"
108,696.56,701.6, known as purity right. And in the association rule mining we use a variety of measures called
109,701.6,705.28," support and confidence. It takes a little bit of work to explain support and confidence. So,"
110,706.0,712.88, different and I talk about association rules in detail. And in more in the reinforcement
111,712.88,717.04," learning task. So, if you remember I told you it is learning to control. So, you are going to have"
112,717.04,722.9599999999999," a cost for controlling the system. And so, the measure here is cost and you would like to minimize"
113,722.9599999999999,728.24," the cost that you are going to accrue while controlling the system. So, these are the basic"
114,728.24,733.4399999999999," machine learning tasks. So, there are several challenges when you are trying to build a"
115,733.5200000000001,738.96," build a machine learning solution right. So, a few of these I have listed on this slide right."
116,738.96,743.6800000000001, The first one is you have to think about how good is a model that you have learned right.
117,743.6800000000001,749.6," So, I talked about a few measures on the previous slide. But often those are not sufficient."
118,749.6,754.32, There are other practical considerations that come into play. And we will look at some of these
119,754.32,762.8000000000001, towards the middle of the course somewhere right. And the bulk of the time would be spent on
120,763.5200000000001,768.08," answering the second question which is how do I choose a model right. So, given some kind of"
121,768.08,773.2800000000001," data which will be the experience that we are talking about. So, given this experience how would"
122,773.2800000000001,779.2," I choose how would I choose a model right that somehow learns what I want to do right. So,"
123,779.2,783.5200000000001," how that improves itself with experience and so on. So, how do I choose this model and how do I"
124,783.5200000000001,787.6800000000001, actually find the parameters of the model that gives me the right answer right.
125,788.4000000000001,792.8800000000001," So, this is what we will spend much of our time on in this course. And then there are a whole"
126,792.88,798.32, bunch of other things that you really have to answer to be able to build a useful
127,799.2,804.96, machine I mean useful data analytics or data mining solutions. Questions like do I have enough
128,804.96,811.28, data do I have enough experience to say that my model is good right. Is the data is
129,811.28,816.16, is it of sufficient quality that could be errors in the data right. Suppose I have medical data
130,816.16,821.36," and age is recorded as 225. So, what does that mean it could be 225 days in which case it is a"
131,822.08,828.0, reasonable number it could be 22.5 years which again it is a reasonable number or 22.5 months
132,828.0,833.36," it is reasonable. But if it is 225 years it is not a reasonable number so, there is something wrong"
133,833.36,839.36," in the data right. So, how do you handle these things or noise in images right or missing values."
134,839.36,845.9200000000001," So, I will talk briefly about handling missing values later in the course. But this is as I mentioned"
135,846.0,851.8399999999999, in the beginning is a machine learning course right. And it is not there is not primarily it is
136,851.8399999999999,856.3199999999999, primarily concerned about the algorithms of machine learning and the and the math and the
137,856.3199999999999,862.64, intuition behind those and not necessarily about the questions of building a practical systems
138,862.64,868.3199999999999," based on this. So, I will be talking about many of these issues during the course. But just that"
139,868.3199999999999,874.9599999999999," I want to read right that will not be the focus right. And so, the next challenge I have listed"
140,875.0400000000001,881.2, here is how confident can I be of the results. And what that I certainly will talk a little bit
141,881.2,889.6, because the whole premise of reporting machine learning results depends on how confident you can
142,889.6,895.44," be of the results right. And the last question am I describing the data correctly. So, that is"
143,895.44,904.0, a very very domain dependent and and and the question that you can answer only with your experience
144,904.0,909.68, as a machine learning or a data data science is professional or with with with time right.
145,909.68,914.32," So, but there are typical questions that you would like to ask that are there on the slides."
146,915.44,920.64," So, from the next in the next module we will look at the different learning paradigms in"
147,921.68,928.48, slightly more detail.
