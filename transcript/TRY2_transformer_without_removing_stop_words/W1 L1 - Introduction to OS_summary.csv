50,50,418.12,425.32, know about the nitty gritty details about the hardware essentially he would need to know what,essentially or as you would see see the nitty gritty details about the hardware anymoreldots are abstracted out,0.45114172488688453
52,52,435.88,442.6, so operating systems essentially provide abstraction they sit in between the applications that we write,so operating systems essentially provide abstraction they sit in between the applications that we write,1.0
53,53,443.24,452.52, and the hardware and abstract all the nitty gritty details of the hardware from the applications,and his abstract all the software call or glotty details of the hardware from the androids,0.5497256811813356
54,54,453.48,460.6, so a simple statement such as this printf sdr would eventually result in something known as,so a simple statement is addablely result in something known as,0.6572825737405329
56,56,467.8,475.72, the string sdr will be displayed onto the monitor everything such as how the color needs to be set,yang be justed onto to execute the os will forcalllet sdr will then manage how hukumnya such as how t dalamisyutely halult it must must gofat in himually respaction inved and introfekty detult and system he color needs to be set and so on much so from the operating system,0.42823265817439515
58,58,483.56,491.3200000000001, so from an application perspective and from a programmer perspective all these details are abstracted out,so dari an application perspective and from a leksantage is the reusable functionality,0.4812302643654213
61,61,509.64,516.04, essentially applications can reuse the operating system functionality so what we mean by this is,that since mean by this system could just reuse the hardware details from the applications and the os will then,0.4283881418653034
